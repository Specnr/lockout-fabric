## Lockout v0.9.0
- The mod is now on version 1.21.3.
- There is a new gamerule (`lockoutBoardSize`) that allows you to play boards of different sizes. You can play boards as small as 3x3, and as large as 7x7. This change also applies to Board Builder. (#10 by @bbb651)
- Fixed most crashes and disconnect bugs.
- Biome/Structure search radius has been reduced to 1000 blocks.
- Status effects are now shown next to the board.
- Board Builder can be opened with existing boards. (`/BoardBuilder <board name>`)
- Updated some icons to better reflect their goals.
- Added 7 goals:
    - Shoot Firework from Crossbow
    - Mine Crafter
    - Light Candle
    - Wear Full Enchanted Armor
    - Put Wolf Armor on Wolf
    - Kill Breeze using Wind Charge
    - Fill Bundle with 16 empty Bundles
- Changed some goals:
    - Obtain End Crystal -> Place End Crystal
    - 'Opponent dies 3 times' is now shared in the team
    - 'Wear a carved pumpkin for 5 minutes' - progress doesn't reset after you stop wearing a pumpkin, it's saved and shown on the board
- Removed some goals:
    - Kill Ender Dragon (there is already 'Obtain Dragon Egg' goal which is more straightforward)
- Some goals are no longer part of the random goal pool, but they can still be played on custom boards:
    - End city related goals - too much rng, cities can spawn thousands of blocks away
    - Opponent obtains seeds/obsidian - no way to force these if it's left as a tie breaker
